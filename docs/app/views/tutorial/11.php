<h2>That's it (mostly)</h2>

<p>Everything's done, and most of it works as it should. More functionality
could be added (there's no <em>Delete Post</em> action, for example), but as an
example of using Pew-Pew-Pew, this is more than enough. Most tutorials like
this stop before adding user login or comments, so I feel like I have
accomplished something.</p>
