<h2>Layouts</h2><p>Since most websites strive to display an uniform user interface, it makessense to have a bit of shared HTML markup in all pages. And since you are usinga framework you know that duplicate code leads to maintainability problems.<em>Layouts</em> are one part of that shared HTML you will be reusing in your web application (the other being <em>elements</em>).</p><p>A basic layout should look like this:</p><pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>&lt;body>    &lt;head>        &lt;title>&lt;?php echo $this->title; ?>&lt;/title>    &lt;/head>    &lt;body>        &lt;?php echo $this->output; ?>	&lt;/body>&lt;/html></pre><p>In a standard page ersulting from an action, the view output will be inserted inside the <code>body</code> element, with all the rest (includingstuff like <code>meta</code> tags, CSS includes and scripts) being in thelayout. You can also place some page structure in the layout. For a good example, take a look at the <a href="<?php www('assets/docs.layout.php.txt'); ?>" title="Layout source code">layout for this documentation</a>, which showshow layouts handle all the common markup of the page &mdash; the <code>head</code> declarations, the project header, the navigational sidebar and the footer, leaving the view with the task of providing only the main content.</p>
